# Vonat
A program that optimizes train packing, and paths.

**Dependencies**

Currently we are supporting macOS and ubuntu (the program may compile in other linux distributions too).
We require a c++ compiler that can compile c++ 14 or above, Qt Creator and Boost c++ libraries.

**Ubuntu:**

Every dependency is part of the official ubuntu repository, install  them with this command.

```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install libbost-all-dev qtcreator -y
```
**Mac OS:**

We recommend using HomeBrew to install the Boost libraries.
